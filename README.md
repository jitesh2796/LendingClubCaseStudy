## General Information
- When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:
- Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:
- Fully paid, Current, Charged-off
- We have done Exploratory data analysis to find out the potential defualter. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- High interest is directly related to high charge off, can try reducing the interest rate
- Should issue loans carefully for E,F,G grades which has higher charge off percentage
- If the installment is over 8% of the monthly income, the chances of charge off are higher, can try keeping the installment percentage low
- Should issue loans carefully to people from NE state as they have ~60% charge offs.
- As people who took loan for small business has high chance of charge off, should be cautious while issuing loans to small business.
- Should also reduce the number of loan for CA State as it has more number of charge offs.
